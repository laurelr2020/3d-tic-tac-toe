<!--
    A framework for writing simple 3D applications with glsim, with
    support for animation and for mouse and keyboard events.  Note
    that you have to uncomment some lines in init() and initGL() to
    enable support for various features.  Look for lines labeled "TODO".
    
    To implement OpenGL 1.1 functions, this page uses glsim.js, which
    simulates a subset of the OpenGL 1.1 API in JavaScript by translating
    the OpenGL functions into WebGL.  In particular WebGL support is
    requried.  The purpose of glsim.js is to make it possible to try
    out some basic OpenGL 1.1 commands.  It does not attempt to be efficient,
    and it covers only a limited subset of OpenGL 1.1.  The subset is
    approximately the one covered in Chapters 2 and 3 of the on-line
    computer graphics textbook at http://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook
